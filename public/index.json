During a lot of the class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.\nProjects Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, five project assignments, invite students to experiment with various tools and techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting your robotic agent system. Additionally, you will be required to submit reflections on the civic learning components if relevant to the particular project. To best ensure that students are ready to develop software after graduation, students will complete most of the lab asprojectssignments in teams. All lab projects in this course will expect students to give both a presentation and a demonstration of the system that they created. Additionally, you will be required to engage in a code review with the instructor for applicable projects.\nCommunity Engagement A significant portion of the course asks the students to study and reflect on public problems related to the field of robotics. As a part of civic learning in this course you will be required to engage in the community. This will mainly involve researching and developing systems to be presented to our community partner.\nExams The exam will cover all of the material in its associated module and are short 10 question assessments completed during the class session. Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students will be expected to take the exams on the scheduled dates.\nAssignment Submission All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.\nDepartment Policies This course will follow department\u0026rsquo;s policies, with more specified applications of the policies described below.\nAttendance General department\u0026rsquo;s policy allows for no more than two weeks of absences without the impact to the course grade. In this class this means, you can miss a total of 8 sessions (class and lab combined) before your final course grade is reduced by a letter grade. A miss of of more than 16 sessions results in a course grade reduction of two letter grades, and so on.\nLate assignments Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied, ideally before the assignment deadline. To apply a token, complete this form. The token can not be used for a final project.\nThese tokens are no‑questions‑asked. They are meant to accommodate emergencies, illnesses, athletic events, so there is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token.\nYou will have 2 tokens, and each can do one of the following:\nExtends one assignment\u0026rsquo;s deadline by two weeks OR Allows resubmit of one project assignments within two weeks after receiving your grade. Resubmits can only be used on projects where an on‑time attempt was made (an attempt means that you have started the assignment and tried at least half the objectives). Artificial Intelligence in Class Use of artificial intelligence is permitted in this class. Students will be asked to supply verbal explanations of their code during code review.\nAllegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements Statement of Community Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.\nAcademic Integrity Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs.
