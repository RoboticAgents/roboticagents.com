	"content": "Overview In this activity, you will demonstrate your ability to wire and control a servo motor using an Arduino Uno. You\u0026rsquo;ll start by using Arduino\u0026rsquo;s built-in Sweep example, then modify the code to create your own custom movement pattern. This is an individual demonstration activity where you\u0026rsquo;ll show your understanding of motor control, circuit wiring, and Arduino programming.\nDue Date: January 28th by 11:50 AM\nLearning Objectives By completing this activity, you will:\nLearn proper wiring techniques for servo motor control Use Arduino\u0026rsquo;s built-in Servo library and examples Modify existing code to create custom servo movements Demonstrate safe handling of electronic components Requirements What You Must Demonstrate Correct wiring of servo motor to the Arduino Uno Run the built-in Sweep example successfully Modify the Sweep code to create a different movement pattern Explain what your modified code does Safe operation (no loose wires, proper power connections) Grading Criteria This is a Class Activity worth points toward your participation grade.\nGrading Rubric (Pass/Fail with feedback):\nCriterion Points Description Sweep Example Working 30% Built-in Sweep example runs successfully; servo moves smoothly Code Modification 30% Created a different movement pattern; code is functional Wiring 20% Servo correctly connected; proper power and ground connections; neat wiring Explanation 20% Can explain what your modified code does; answers instructor questions To Pass: You must achieve at least 70% overall. Incomplete wiring or non-functional code will require you to debug and re-demonstrate.\nPart 1: Understanding Servo Motors What is a Servo Motor? A servo motor is a motor with built-in position control. It can rotate to a specific angle (typically 0-180°) and hold that position. Servos are perfect for:\nRobot arms and grippers Camera pan/tilt mechanisms RC vehicles (steering) Key Features:\nBuilt-in controller and gears 3-wire connection (Power, Ground, Signal) Precise angular positioning Easy to control with Arduino Part 2: Wiring Your Servo Components Needed: Arduino Uno Standard servo motor (e.g., SG90, TowerPro MG996R) 3 jumper wires USB cable Wiring Instructions: Servo Motor Wire Colors (standard):\nBROWN/BLACK wire → GND (Arduino) RED wire → 5V (Arduino) ORANGE/YELLOW/WHITE wire → Pin 9 (Arduino) ⚠️ Important: Wire colors may vary by manufacturer, but the pattern is typically: signal-power-ground or ground-power-signal.\nWiring Diagram: Arduino Uno Servo Motor ┌─────────────┐ ┌──────────┐ │ │ │ Servo │ │ 5V ●──RED─────┤ +5V │ │ GND ●──BROWN───┤ GND │ │ │ │ │ │ Pin 9 (PWM)├─ORANGE──┤ Signal │ │ │ │ │ └─────────────┘ └──────────┘ Visual Connection:\nArduino Uno ┌─────────────────┐ │ [ ] 5V ●───────┐ │ [ ] GND ●───┐ │ │ [ ] 13 [ ] │ │ │ [ ] 12 [ ] │ │ │ [ ] 11~ [ ] │ │ │ [ ] 10~ [ ] │ │ │ [ ] 9~ ●─┐ │ │ │ [ ] 8 [ ] │ │ │ └─────────────────┘ │ │ │ │ │ │ ORANGE │ │ │ ┌────┘ │ │ │ BROWN │ │ │ ┌─────┘ │ │ │ RED │ │ │ ┌──────┘ ┌──┴──┴──┴───┐ │ SERVO │ │ MOTOR │ └────────────┘ Connection Checklist:\nBrown/Black wire connected to GND Red wire connected to 5V Orange/Yellow/White wire connected to Pin 9 All connections are secure No wires are touching each other Part 3: Running the Sweep Example Step 1: Open the Built-in Example Connect your Arduino to your computer via USB Open Arduino IDE Go to: File → Examples → Servo → Sweep A new window will open with the Sweep example code Step 2: Upload and Test Select your Arduino board: Tools → Board → Arduino Uno Select your port: Tools → Port → [your Arduino port] Click the Upload button (→) Watch your servo sweep back and forth! What the Sweep Example Does:\nMoves the servo from 0° to 180° gradually Pauses briefly at 180° Moves back from 180° to 0° Repeats continuously Step 3: Verify It Works ✅ Your servo should smoothly sweep back and forth\n✅ The movement should be continuous\n✅ No error messages in the Arduino IDE\nIf it doesn\u0026rsquo;t work, see the Troubleshooting section at the end of this document.\nPart 4: Modify the Code Now that you have the Sweep example working, modify it to create a different movement pattern. Here are some ideas:\nModification Ideas: Different Angles: Make it sweep between different angles (e.g., 45° to 135° instead of 0° to 180°) Different Speed: Change the delay to make it move faster or slower Multiple Positions: Make it move to 3-4 specific positions instead of sweeping continuously Back-and-forth: Make it go to 90°, back to 0°, to 180°, back to 0°, repeat Your Own Pattern: Create any unique movement pattern you want! Requirements for Your Modification: Must be different from the original Sweep example Must be functional (code compiles and runs without errors) Must create visible movement in the servo Should demonstrate your understanding of servo control Example Modification Ideas in Words: Example 1: \u0026ldquo;Move to 0°, wait 1 second, move to 90°, wait 1 second, move to 180°, wait 1 second, repeat\u0026rdquo;\nExample 2: \u0026ldquo;Sweep from 30° to 150° faster than the original, then pause for 2 seconds\u0026rdquo;\nExample 3: \u0026ldquo;Move to center (90°), sweep left to 0°, back to center, sweep right to 180°, back to center, repeat\u0026rdquo;\nPart 5: Demonstration When \u0026amp; Where In class, on Monday, January 26th or during lab, on Tuesday, January 27th, demonstrate your servo functionality to the instructor. Troubleshooting Servo Issues Problem Possible Cause Solution Servo doesn\u0026rsquo;t move at all Wrong pin or loose wire Verify Pin 9 is used; check all connections Servo jitters/vibrates Insufficient power Try external 5V supply for high-torque servos Servo moves erratically Loose connections Secure all jumper wires firmly Code won\u0026rsquo;t compile Library issue Servo library is built-in; restart Arduino IDE Servo moves but not correctly Code issue Check your angle values (must be 0-180) Common Code Issues myservo.write(angle): Make sure angle is between 0 and 180 delay(ms): Time is in milliseconds (1000 ms = 1 second) Forgetting to call myservo.attach(9): Must be in setup() function Additional Resources Arduino Documentation Servo Library Reference Basic Servo Control Tutorial Safety Reminders Never connect motors directly to Arduino pins without understanding power requirements Always double-check power and ground connections before plugging in USB If a servo gets hot, disconnect immediately and check your wiring Don\u0026rsquo;t force servos by hand when powered - you can damage internal gears Learning Outcomes Alignment This activity supports the following course learning outcomes:\nLO2: Demonstrate proficiency in programming robotic systems LO3: Apply fundamental concepts of sensors and actuators LO4: Design, build, and test robotic systems "

Rotation around wheel axle 2. Rotation around ground contact point Constraint: Can only roll in one direction\nCannot move sideways (would require skidding)\nExample: Bicycle wheel, car wheel\nCaster Wheel (3 DoF) Three degrees of freedom:\nRotation around wheel axle Rotation around ground contact Rotation around caster axis Can reorient to roll in any direction!\nExample: Shopping cart, office chair\nSwedish/Mecanum Wheel (3 DoF) Three degrees of freedom:\nRotation around main wheel axle Rotation around ground contact Rotation around roller axles Rollers on circumference allow sideways motion while wheel spins forward\nResult: True omnidirectional movement!\nKinematic Constraints 3-DoF wheels = Free movement on a plane\n2-DoF wheels = Constrained movement\nBut constrained ≠ unreachable!\nA car can parallel park Requires multiple maneuvers Like a knight on a chessboard Mobile Robot DoF on a Plane Plane has 3 Cartesian DoF:\nX position Y position Orientation (angle θ) Robots without 3-DoF wheels have kinematic constraints\nThey may need multiple moves to reach certain poses\nManipulator Arms: Mechanical DoF Each actuated joint typically adds 1 mechanical DoF\nOn a plane (2D workspace):\nUp/down position Left/right position End-effector orientation 3 Cartesian DoF needed → Need ≥3 joints\nJoint Types Revolute (Rotary) Joint:\nMost common Rotates around an axis Example: Elbow, shoulder Prismatic (Linear) Joint:\nExtends and contracts Slides along an axis Example: Telescope, piston Design Trade-offs Choosing kinematics involves balancing:\n✓ Mechanical complexity ✓ Maneuverability ✓ Precision ✓ Cost ✓ Ease of control Example: Differential drive (2 wheels) vs. car steering\n• Differential: cheap, maneuverable, hard to drive straight\n• Car steering: expensive, precise, hard to parallel park\nReal Robot: Differential Drive Configuration:\nTwo powered wheels on shared axis One (or two) caster wheels for support Advantages:\nVery maneuverable (can spin in place) Simple control Low cost Challenge:\nHard to drive perfectly straight Requires matched motors and wheels Key Takeaways Actuation enables locomotion and manipulation Stability can be static (at rest) or dynamic (requires motion) DoF describes what movements are possible Wheel type determines mobility constraints Design choices involve complex trade-offs Before Next Class Building your wheeled robot!\nThink about:\nWhat DoF does your robot need? Static or dynamic stability? Which wheel configuration? What trade-offs will you make? Questions?

	"description": "Hands-on Arduino distance sensing with ultrasonic and IR sensors",
	"content": "Overview In this activity, you will wire and experiment with two types of distance sensors: an ultrasonic sensor (HC-SR04) and an infrared (IR) obstacle detection sensor. You\u0026rsquo;ll test how each sensor responds to different objects, surfaces, and distances. This is a team demonstration activity where you\u0026rsquo;ll show your understanding of sensor operation and explore their strengths and limitations.\nTeams: Work in groups of 2-3 students\nDue Date: Monday, February 3rd by 11:50 AM\nLearning Objectives By completing this activity, you will:\nWire and operate ultrasonic and IR distance sensors Understand how different sensors detect obstacles Explore sensor performance across various conditions Learn when to use each sensor type in robotics applications Requirements What You Must Demonstrate Wire both sensors correctly to Arduino Uno Show both sensors working with Serial Monitor output Conduct at least 2 experiments per sensor from the suggested list below Explain your findings to the instructor Grading Criteria This is a Class Activity worth points toward your participation grade.\nGrading Rubric (Pass/Fail with feedback):\nCriterion Points Description Ultrasonic Wiring \u0026amp; Demo 25% HC-SR04 correctly wired; distance readings displayed IR Wiring \u0026amp; Demo 25% IR sensor correctly wired; obstacle detection working Experiments 30% Completed at least 2 experiments per sensor; systematic testing Explanation 20% Can explain sensor behavior; answers instructor questions To Pass: You must achieve at least 70% overall. Both sensors must be functional.\nPart 1: Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04) Understanding Ultrasonic Sensors The HC-SR04 uses sound waves (40 kHz ultrasonic) to measure distance:\nSends out a sound pulse Measures time for echo to return Calculates distance: distance = (time × speed_of_sound) / 2 Specifications:\nRange: 2 cm to 400 cm Accuracy: ±3 mm Beam angle: ~15° Wiring the HC-SR04 Components:\nArduino Uno HC-SR04 ultrasonic sensor 4 jumper wires Breadboard (optional) HC-SR04 Pin Arduino Pin Purpose VCC 5V Power TRIG Any digital pin (e.g., Pin 9) Trigger pulse ECHO Any digital pin (e.g., Pin 10) Echo response GND GND Ground Arduino Code for HC-SR04 // HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor #define TRIG_PIN 9 #define ECHO_PIN 10 void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); pinMode(TRIG_PIN, OUTPUT); pinMode(ECHO_PIN, INPUT); Serial.println(\u0026#34;HC-SR04 Test - Distance in cm:\u0026#34;); } void loop() { // Send trigger pulse digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW); delayMicroseconds(2); digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, HIGH); delayMicroseconds(10); digitalWrite(TRIG_PIN, LOW); // Measure echo duration long duration = pulseIn(ECHO_PIN, HIGH); // Calculate distance in cm float distance = duration * 0.034 / 2; Serial.print(\u0026#34;Distance: \u0026#34;); Serial.print(distance); Serial.println(\u0026#34; cm\u0026#34;); delay(500); } Part 2: Infrared (IR) Obstacle Sensor Understanding IR Sensors Digital IR sensors emit infrared light and detect reflections:\nOutput: HIGH (1) when no obstacle detected, LOW (0) when obstacle is present The sensor compares reflected IR light intensity to an internal threshold If reflection is strong enough (object is close/reflective), output goes LOW If reflection is weak (object far/absent), output stays HIGH Key Component - Potentiometer:\nSmall adjustable screw or dial on the sensor Controls the sensitivity threshold - how much reflected light triggers detection Turn clockwise → sensor becomes more sensitive (detects from farther away) Turn counter-clockwise → sensor becomes less sensitive (only detects very close objects) This lets you tune the sensor for your specific use case Typical range: 2-30 cm (adjustable via potentiometer)\nWiring the IR Sensor Components:\nArduino Uno IR obstacle detection sensor 3 jumper wires IR Sensor Pin Arduino Pin Purpose VCC 5V Power OUT Any digital pin (e.g., Pin 2) Detection signal GND GND Ground Arduino Code for IR Sensor // Digital IR Obstacle Sensor #define IR_PIN 2 void setup() { Serial.begin(9600); pinMode(IR_PIN, INPUT); Serial.println(\u0026#34;IR Sensor Test:\u0026#34;); } void loop() { int sensorState = digitalRead(IR_PIN); if (sensorState == LOW) { Serial.println(\u0026#34;OBSTACLE DETECTED!\u0026#34;); } else { Serial.println(\u0026#34;Clear\u0026#34;); } delay(300); } Tip: The IR sensor outputs binary (0 or 1) values. Adjust the potentiometer to set when it switches from 0→1:\nClockwise rotation = more sensitive = detects farther away Counter-clockwise = less sensitive = only detects very close objects Find the \u0026ldquo;sweet spot\u0026rdquo; for your detection distance by testing with an object and slowly turning the potentiometer Part 3: Suggested Experiments For Ultrasonic Sensor: Distance Test: Measure objects at 10cm, 30cm, 50cm, 100cm - how accurate is it? Surface Test: Try flat wall, angled surface (45°), soft material (cloth/foam) Object Size: Test with large box, thin object (pencil), your hand Material Test: Compare wood, metal, cardboard, plastic For IR Sensor: Distance Range: Find minimum and maximum detection distances Color Test: Try white paper, black paper, colored objects Surface Test: Compare matte vs. glossy/reflective surfaces Angle Test: Move object side-to-side to find detection angle Choose at least 2 experiments per sensor to demonstrate.\nPart 4: Demonstration Checklist When demonstrating to the instructor, be ready to:\n✓ Show both sensors wired correctly ✓ Display Serial Monitor output for both sensors ✓ Demonstrate at least 2 experiments per sensor ✓ Explain what you observed and why ✓ Answer questions about sensor behavior Troubleshooting Ultrasonic Sensor Issues Problem Solution Always reads 0 or 400+ cm Check wiring; verify TRIG and ECHO pins Inconsistent readings Test in quiet environment; ensure stable power IR Sensor Issues Problem Solution Always/never detects Adjust potentiometer; check wiring Inconsistent detection Calibrate for specific distance Resources HC-SR04 Datasheet Arduino pulseIn() Documentation Good luck exploring robot perception! 🤖📏\n"

Step 1: Check battery specifications\nStandard AA alkaline battery = 1.5V nominal Rechargeable NiMH AA = 1.2V nominal Step 2: Batteries in series add voltages\n4 batteries × 1.5V each = 6V total (Or 4 × 1.2V = 4.8V for rechargeable) Series vs. Parallel Batteries Series (end-to-end): Voltages ADD\n(+) → Battery 1 → Battery 2 → Battery 3 → Battery 4 → (−) Total: 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V + 1.5V = 6V Capacity stays same (e.g., 2000 mAh) Parallel (side-by-side): Capacity ADDS\nAll (+) terminals connected, all (−) connected Voltage stays 1.5V Capacity: 2000 + 2000 + 2000 + 2000 = 8000 mAh Battery Voltage Over Time Battery State Alkaline AA Your 4× AA Pack Fresh 1.5V - 1.6V 6.0V - 6.4V Nominal 1.5V 6.0V 50% used 1.3V 5.2V Depleted 1.0V 4.0V ⚠️ Motors slow down as batteries drain!\nWhy We Need Motor Drivers Critical Problem: Arduino pins cannot directly power motors!\nArduino Pin Limitations Arduino digital pin specifications:\nMax current per pin: 40 mA Recommended current: 20 mA Max voltage: 5V Your yellow DC motor requirements:\nOperating current: 150-300 mA Stall current: 1-2 A (when blocked) Voltage: 3-6V Motor draws 10× more current than Arduino can provide!\nWhat Happens Without a Driver? ❌ Scenario 1: Connect motor directly to Arduino pin\nArduino pin tries to supply 150+ mA Pin is rated for only 20-40 mA Result: Damaged Arduino! (burned pin or entire chip) ❌ Scenario 2: Motor stalls (gets stuck)\nCurrent spikes to 1-2 A Result: Permanent damage to Arduino! Motor Driver to the Rescue! Motor Driver = Power transistor bridge controlled by low-current signals\nHow it works:\nArduino sends LOW-CURRENT control signals (\u0026lt; 20 mA) Motor driver switches HIGH-CURRENT from battery (1-2 A) Motor gets power from battery, NOT Arduino Arduino stays safe! Motor Driver Functions ✅ Current amplification: Arduino controls, battery powers\n✅ Direction control: H-bridge reverses current flow\n✅ Speed control: PWM from Arduino → PWM to motor\n✅ Protection: Some drivers have overcurrent protection\n✅ Isolation: Keeps motor noise away from Arduino\nAnalogy: Motor driver is like a remote-controlled power switch that can handle heavy loads\nBreadboard Basics Solderless prototyping platform Horizontal rows: Connected internally (for components) Vertical rails: Connected vertically (for power/ground distribution) Red rail: Typically connected to positive voltage (5V) Blue/Black rail: Typically connected to ground (GND) Center gap: Separates two sides, perfect for ICs DC Motors for Project 1 Yellow Geared DC Motors Type: Brushed DC motor with gear reduction Voltage: Typically 3-6V (perfect for 4× AA = 6V!) Application: Wheeled robot car (differential drive) Power: Comes with 4× AA battery holder (6V, ~2000 mAh) Characteristics: High speed reduced by internal gears Increased torque for moving robot weight Simple two-wire control (polarity determines direction) Current draw: 150-300 mA running, 1-2A stall Motor Driver: L298N Purpose: Controls motor speed and direction H-Bridge configuration: Allows bidirectional control Specifications: Drives 2 DC motors independently Up to 2A per channel Logic voltage: 5V (from Arduino) Motor voltage: 5-35V (from battery) Control: IN1/IN2 pins control Motor A direction IN3/IN4 pins control Motor B direction ENA/ENB pins control speed (PWM) Alternative Motor Drivers TB6612FNG:\nMore efficient than L298N Lower voltage drop Up to 1.2A per channel Better for smaller motors WWZMDiB Motor Driver:\nCompact design Integrated motor control Good for space-constrained projects You may use any of these drivers for Project 1!\nTypes of Electric Motors Brushed DC Motors Mechanism: Commutator switches current direction via brushes Advantages: Simple control (voltage → speed) Inexpensive Wide availability Disadvantages: Brush wear over time Lower efficiency due to friction Maintenance required Brushless DC Motors Mechanism: Electronic commutation (no brushes) Advantages: Higher efficiency Longer lifespan More torque per weight Less maintenance Disadvantages: Requires electronic speed controller (ESC) More expensive Complex control Applications: Drones, RC cars, industrial robots Stepper Motors Mechanism: Precise rotation in fixed steps (e.g., 1.8° per step) Advantages: Precise position control without encoder Hold position when powered Predictable movement Disadvantages: Lower top speed Can lose steps under high load Requires specific driver Applications: 3D printers, CNC machines, robotic arms Servo Motors Components: DC motor + gears + encoder + controller Types: Standard: 0-180° rotation Continuous: 360° rotation with speed control Digital: Faster response, more torque Advantages: Built-in position control Easy to use (single signal wire) Compact package Applications: RC vehicles, robotic arms, grippers Other Actuation Technologies Hydraulic Actuators Mechanism: Pressurized liquid in pistons Advantages: Very high force Disadvantages: Large, expensive, maintenance-intensive Applications: Construction equipment, large legged robots Pneumatic Actuators Mechanism: Compressed air Advantages: Lightweight, safe, compliant Disadvantages: Lower force than hydraulics Applications: Soft robotics, grippers, robotic fish Motor Control Considerations Speed Control PWM (Pulse Width Modulation): (as we discussed earlier!) Rapidly switch motor on/off Duty cycle determines average voltage Higher duty cycle = faster speed Arduino analogWrite() function (0-255) Use PWM pins: 3, 5, 6, 9, 10, 11 Direction Control H-Bridge circuit: Four switches control current flow Forward: Current flows one direction Reverse: Current flows opposite direction Brake: Short both motor terminals to ground Safety Considerations Active Safety Torque limiting: Monitor motor current Collision detection: Compare expected vs actual torque Emergency stop: Cut power immediately Passive Safety Mechanical limits: Physical stops on motion Compliant mechanisms: Springs, flexible materials Fail-safe brakes: Engage when power lost Current limiting: Fuses and circuit breakers Motor Selection Criteria For your wheeled robot, consider:\nTorque: Can it move your robot\u0026rsquo;s weight? Speed: How fast should it go? Voltage: Match your power supply (typically 5-6V) Current: Does your driver/battery support it? Size/Weight: Fits your chassis design Cost: Within project budget Next Steps for Project 1 This week: Mechanical build, wiring, power setup Install fresh batteries (4× AA = 6V) Test motors individually before mounting Verify motor driver connections (common mistake: reversed polarity) Start with low PWM values (50-100) to test safely Check battery voltage regularly (should read ~6V when fresh) Document your wiring (take photos!) Check-in: Come to lab hours if motors aren\u0026rsquo;t spinning!\nKey Takeaways Digital = ON/OFF; Analog = range of values; PWM = fake analog using fast switching 4× AA batteries in series = 6V (1.5V each) Arduino pins (20-40 mA) cannot power motors (150-300 mA) directly Motor drivers amplify control signals and protect Arduino DC motors offer simple speed control via PWM (0-255) Different motor types trade off precision, force, speed, and cost Questions?\n"

	"content": "Instructor Dr. Janyl Jumadinova\nOffice Location: Alden Hall 110\nOffice Phone: +1 814-332-2881\nEmail: jjumadinova@allegheny.edu\nOffice Hours\nDescription A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field\u0026rsquo;s technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions.\nPrerequisite: CMPSC 101 or CMPSC 102.\nFocus: Quantitative Reasoning, Civic Learning.\nMaterials There is no required textbook for this course. All reading material will be provided by the instructor and linked on the course schedule.\nLearning Outcomes Identify components of the robot and associate each part with its task in a complete robotic system. Design, implement, and test robotic applications for a wheeled, arm, and aerial robots. Demonstrate the use of a robot operating system (ROS) in simulation and in wheeled robots. Demonstrate actuating, sensing, locomotion, navigation, manipulation, and learning capabilities of robotic systems. Describe the ethical and social impact of robotics on public problems and participate in civic engagement activities with robots, while additionally reflecting on the nuances of public problems. Distribution Learning Outcomes Civic Learning (CL): Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of economic, political, legal, cultural, natural, historical, or social forces that affect public problems or civic issues.\nProgram learning outcomes 2 and 5 satisfy CL learning outcome.\nQuantitative Reasoning (QR): Students who successfully complete this requirement will demonstrate an understanding of how to interpret numeric data and/or their graphical or symbolic representations.\nProgram learning outcomes 2, 3, and 4 satisfy QR learning outcome.\nCommunity Guidelines Interactions of students amongst themselves, as well as with the course instructor must be respectful at all times. All members of the course are expected to contribute to the classroom environment being welcoming, inclusive, and engaging.\nCourse members are representatives of this course, Computer and Information Science department, and Allegheny College, when engaging in the local community, and as such must present the best representation of themselves. All members must learn about the community with which they are to engage and consider the impacts of their communications, actions and interactions in the community.\nWhen working as a team, all project decisions should be made as a team. Team members must decide how they conduct the work, divide the work as needed, and should hold each other accountable. All project work must be completed in a branch on GitHub, and allow for appropriate GitHub flow process using Pull Requests and Merges. Team members should use Discord and GitHub to communicate with each other about the project.\nEach team is responsible for the hardware they work with during each project. All supplies taken out of ALIC need to be documented in the project\u0026rsquo;s report. All tools and supplies must be returned to ALIC when are no longer in use.\nPolicies Communication GitHub and Discord are the main digital channels used in this course for communication. Students are responsible for regularly checking these platforms to ensure that important messages are not being missed.\nGrading Structure Category Total Points Number of Items Points per Item In-Class Activities 10 10 1 Projects 40 5 8 Community Engagement 10 2 5 Exams 30 3 10 Final Project 10 1 10 Total 100 — — Grading Scale Grading scale A 96 - 100 A- 90 - 95.9 B+ 87 - 89.9 B 83 - 86.9 B- 80 - 82.9 C+ 77 - 79.9 C 73 - 76.9 C- 70 - 72.9 D+ 67 - 69.9 D 60 - 66.9 F 59.9 and below Class Activities All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During a lot of the class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.\nProjects Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, five project assignments, invite students to experiment with various tools and techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting your robotic agent system. Additionally, you will be required to submit reflections on the civic learning components if relevant to the particular project. To best ensure that students are ready to develop software after graduation, students will complete most of the lab asprojectssignments in teams. All lab projects in this course will expect students to give both a presentation and a demonstration of the system that they created. Additionally, you will be required to engage in a code review with the instructor for applicable projects.\nCommunity Engagement A significant portion of the course asks the students to study and reflect on public problems related to the field of robotics. As a part of civic learning in this course you will be required to engage in the community. This will mainly involve researching and developing systems to be presented to our community partner.\nExams The exam will cover all of the material in its associated module and are short 10 question assessments completed during the class session. Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students will be expected to take the exams on the scheduled dates.\nAssignment Submission All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.\nDepartment Policies This course will follow department\u0026rsquo;s policies, with more specified applications of the policies described below.\nAttendance General department\u0026rsquo;s policy allows for no more than two weeks of absences without the impact to the course grade. In this class this means, you can miss a total of 8 sessions (class and lab combined) before your final course grade is reduced by a letter grade. A miss of of more than 16 sessions results in a course grade reduction of two letter grades, and so on.\nLate assignments Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied, ideally before the assignment deadline. To apply a token, complete this form. The token can not be used for a final project.\nThese tokens are no‑questions‑asked. They are meant to accommodate emergencies, illnesses, athletic events, so there is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token.\nYou will have 2 tokens, and each can do one of the following:\nExtends one assignment\u0026rsquo;s deadline by two weeks OR Allows resubmit of one project assignments within two weeks after receiving your grade. Resubmits can only be used on projects where an on‑time attempt was made (an attempt means that you have started the assignment and tried at least half the objectives). Artificial Intelligence in Class Use of artificial intelligence is permitted in this class. Students will be asked to supply verbal explanations of their code during code review.\nAllegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements Statement of Community Allegheny students and employees are committed to creating an inclusive, respectful and safe residential learning community that will actively confront and challenge racism, sexism, heterosexism, religious bigotry, and other forms of harassment and discrimination. We encourage individual growth by promoting a free exchange of ideas in a setting that values diversity, trust and equality. So that the right of all to participate in a shared learning experience is upheld, Allegheny affirms its commitment to the principles of freedom of speech and inquiry, while at the same time fostering responsibility and accountability in the exercise of these freedoms.\nAcademic Integrity Allegheny College has a student-run Honor Code designed to promote individual responsibility and integrity in academic affairs. Each student pledges the following: “I hereby recognize and pledge to fulfill my responsibilities, as defined in the Honor Code, and to maintain the integrity of both myself and the College community as a whole.” Your professor will educate you about the meaning of academic integrity in this course, which may be different in some respects from other courses in which you are enrolled. Please ask the professor if you have questions. Please see academic honor program\u0026rsquo;s website for more details.\nMidterm Grades Midterm grades will be submitted for all students in this course by Monday, March 17, but will not appear on academic transcripts. By giving you an early indication of your performance so far, midterm grades offer an opportunity to make adjustments, if necessary, before the end of the term. While midterm grades are primarily focused on first and second-year students, upper-level students may also receive them in some courses. This feedback is a key part of our commitment to supporting your academic journey.\nSeeking Assistance Assistance with course concepts Students who struggle to understand knowledge and skills defined in this course are encouraged to seek assistance from the instructor.

Both faculty and students have the reasonable expectation that class content is shared only with those who are members of the Allegheny College community; therefore, audio, video, or cell phone recording of any class at Allegheny is prohibited unless prior written permission of the instructor has been obtained and all students in the class as well as guest speakers have been informed that audio/video recording may occur. Classes may also be recorded if approved as an educational accommodation through Student Accessibility and Support services. Recordings may not be reproduced or uploaded to publicly accessible web environments, nor may they be exchanged or distributed for commercial purposes, for compensation, or for any purpose other than individual or group study, except with the express written permission of the involved parties. See Section 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook for the full “Recording Policy.”\nHarassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.\nAllegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.\nAllegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.\nAllegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX. Trae Yeckley, Dean for Student Life and Title IX Coordinator 814-332-3085 (direct line), titleix@allegheny.edu , Student Life Suite, Campus Center\nYou can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator may take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community.\nNB: On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the Biden administration’s 2024 Title IX regulations. The vacatur applies nationwide, meaning the 2020 Title IX final rule and Title IX regulations are effective. Due to this ruling, Allegheny College reverted back to their Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures prior to August 1, 2024.\nNotice that Faculty are Responsible Employees with Mandatory Reporting Obligations:\nUnless specifically identified otherwise by policy, all faculty, staff, and administrators of Allegheny College are considered mandated reporters and are required to notify the College’s Title IX Coordinator of any incident of discrimination and harassment disclosed to them, or known to them, involving a member of the campus community. Mandated reporting helps to ensure that individuals who are experiencing or have experienced discrimination or harassment are connected to the full range of resources and options afforded to them. If you are in need of support or advocacy and wish to discuss such matters confidentially, you are invited to consult any of the resources listed below. Unlike other College employees, the options below are confidential and are exempt from mandatory reporting obligations to the Title IX Coordinator.
