{{< lead >}} Complex modern digital problems often require sophisticated intelligent computer programs, or agents, that act autonomously on behalf of their users and interact with hardware. Here, we explore foundational principles behind robotic agents and the civic issues, public challenges, and opportunities in this field. {{< /lead >}}

{{< alert style="info" >}} This course explores topics of robot mechanisms, sensing and actuating, and robot computation. It also invites participates to use the topics of robotics to engage the community, offering demonstrations and presentations on various topics and projects.  {{< /alert >}}
