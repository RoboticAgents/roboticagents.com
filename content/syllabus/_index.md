## Description

A study of the design and implementation of autonomous software agents and robotic systems that cooperatively complete complex tasks. In addition to examining techniques for large-scale coordination and group-based decision-making, students learn how to apply the field's technologies to address the challenges facing local and global communities. Participating in hands-on activities that often require teamwork, students develop and evaluate several multi-agent or multi-robot systems, while also reflecting on the civic issues surrounding the use of these systems. During a weekly laboratory session students use state-of-the-art technology to complete projects, reporting on their results through both written documents and oral presentations. Students are invited to use their own departmentally approved laptop in this course; a limited number of laptops are available for use during class and lab sessions. 

Prerequisite: CMPSC 101 or CMPSC 102.

Focus: Quantitative Reasoning, Civic Learning.

## Community Guidelines

Interactions of students amongst themselves, as well as with the course instructor  must be respectful at all times. All members of the course are expected to contribute to the classroom environment being welcoming, inclusive, and engaging. 

Course members are representatives of this course, Computer and Information Science department, and Allegheny College, when engaging in the local community, and as such must present the best representation of themselves. All members must learn about the community with which they are to engage and consider the impacts of their communications, actions and interactions in the community.

When working as a team, all project decisions should be made as a team. Team members must decide how they conduct the work, divide the work as needed, and should hold each other accountable. All project work must be completed in a branch on GitHub, and allow for appropriate GitHub flow process using Pull Requests and Merges. Team members should use Discord and GitHub to communicate with each other about the project.

Each team is responsible for the hardware they work with during each project. All supplies taken out of ALIC need to be documented in the project's report. All tools and supplies must be returned to ALIC when are no longer in use. 

## Policies

### Communication

GitHub and Discord are the main digital channels used in this course for communication. Students are responsible for regularly checking these platforms to ensure that important messages are not being missed.

#### Class Activities

All students are required to actively participate during all of the class sessions. During a lot of the class sessions, you will be required to complete and submit class activities (individually and in teams). You will receive a checkmark grade (1) if you complete more than 70% of the activity; otherwise you will receive a 0.

#### Projects

Graded on a percentage and credit/no-credit basis, five project assignments, invite students to experiment with various tools and techniques for designing, implementing, evaluating, and documenting your robotic agent system. Additionally, you will be required to submit reflections on the civic learning components if relevant to the particular project.  To best ensure that students are ready to develop software  after graduation, students will complete most of the lab asprojectssignments in teams. All lab projects in this course will expect students to give both a presentation and a demonstration of the system that they created. Additionally, you will be required to engage in a code review with the instructor for applicable projects.

#### Community Engagement

A significant portion of the course asks the students to study and reflect on public problems related to the field of robotics. As a part of civic learning in this course you will be required to engage in the community. This will mainly involve researching and developing systems to be presented to our community partner. 

#### Exams

The exam will cover all of the material in its associated module and are short 10 question assessments completed during the class session. Unless prior arrangements are made with the instructor, all students will be expected to take the exams on the
scheduled dates. 

#### Assignment Submission

All assignments have a stated due date and are to be turned in on that due date. By submitting each assignment a student pledges that they have complied with Allegheny Honor Code. You must follow assignment instructions for submitting your projects in order for them to be graded. Unless special arrangements are made with the course instructor, no assignments will be accepted after the late deadline.

### Department Policies

This course will follow [department's policies](https://www.cis.allegheny.edu/teaching/policies/), with more specified applications of the policies described below.

### Attendance

General department's policy allows for no more than two weeks of absences without the impact to the course grade. In this class this means, you can miss a total of 8 sessions (class and lab combined) before your final course grade is reduced by a letter grade. A miss of of more than 16 sessions results in a course grade reduction of two letter grades, and so on.

### Late assignments

Late assignments will not be accepted unless a token is applied, ideally before the assignment deadline. To apply a token, complete [this form](https://forms.gle/5VTNBhkM92tfXHFU9). The token can not be used for a final project.

These tokens are no‑questions‑asked. They are meant to accommodate emergencies, illnesses, athletic events, so there
is no need to provide an excuse when applying a token.

You will have 2 tokens, and each can do one of the following:
- Extends one assignment's deadline by two weeks
OR
- Allows resubmit of one project assignments within two weeks after receiving your grade. Resubmits can
only be used on projects where an on‑time attempt was made (an attempt means that you have
started the assignment and tried at least half the objectives).

## Artificial Intelligence in Class 

Use of artificial intelligence is permitted in this class. Students will be asked to supply verbal explanations of their code during code review.

## Allegheny College Policy and Awareness Statements

### Statement of Community

See Section 9.8 of the Faculty Handbook for the full “Recording Policy.”

#### Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Reporting

Allegheny College is committed to providing a workplace and educational environment that is free from all forms of harassment, discrimination, and sexual misconduct. The College expressly prohibits discrimination and harassment on the basis of race, color, national origin, ethnicity, sex, sexual orientation, gender, gender identity, gender expression, age, religion, and disability. Allegheny College prohibits sex-based harassment, sexual violence, intimate partner violence, and stalking regardless of the gender, gender identity, gender expression, or sexual orientation of the individuals involved in any education program or activity that it operates, as required by Title IX, including admission and employment.

Allegheny College adheres to all federal, state, and local civil rights laws prohibiting discrimination in employment and education. The College does not discriminate in its admissions practices, in its employment practices, or in its educational programs or activities. Allegheny College also prohibits retaliation against any person participating in good faith in any discrimination investigation or complaint process internal or external to the institution; for bringing a complaint of discrimination or harassment or for assisting someone with such a complaint.

Allegheny College is required to respond promptly and effectively, utilizing a fair, transparent, and reliable process, when they have knowledge of conduct that reasonably may constitute sex discrimination in its program, and must take steps to prevent the recurrence of discrimination and remedy its effects, the college must communicate their policies and procedures to all students, employees, and other participants in their programs and must monitor and address barriers to reporting instances of sex discrimination.

Allegheny College employees must notify their Title IX Coordinator when they have information that may reasonably rise to the level of sex discrimination, so long as the employee is not a confidential employee, as defined on page 3 of this policy. All employees must be trained upon hiring and annually thereafter on (i) the College’s obligation to address sex discrimination, (ii) the scope of conduct that constitutes sex discrimination under Title IX, including sex-based harassment, and (iii) all duties of employees upon receipt of a report of sex discrimination, including to provide the reporting individual with contact information for the Title IX Coordinator and information about how to report sex discrimination under Title IX.

You can access support and resources even if you do not want to take any further action. The College respects your right to file or not file a formal complaint. The Title IX Coordinator may take action only in situations that pose a serious threat of harm to you or the community. 

NB: On January 9, 2025, the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Kentucky vacated the Biden administration’s 2024 Title IX regulations. The vacatur applies nationwide, meaning the 2020 Title IX final rule and Title IX regulations are effective. Due to this ruling, Allegheny College reverted back to their Harassment, Discrimination, and Sexual Misconduct Policy and Procedures prior to August 1, 2024.
